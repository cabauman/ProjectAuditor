# Diagnostics
Project Auditor reports several types of recommendations. Each of them is uniquely identified by a string ID containing 3 letters, followed by 4 digits. 

The main types of recommendations are related to Code and Settings. Their IDs start with PAC and PAS respectively (Project Auditor Code/Setting).

Note that there are different ranges within both Code and Settings diagnostic IDs:
- Code:
  - `PAC0xxx`: for Unity API
  - `PAC1xxx`: for System.*
  - `PAC2xxx`: other IDs defined in code rather than in the json
- Settings:
  - `PAS0xxx`: Unity settings 
  - `PAS1xxx`: other settings IDs defined in code rather than in the json
  - `PAT0xxx`: texture related settings
  - `PAM0xxx`: mesh related settings
